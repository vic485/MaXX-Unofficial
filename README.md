# MaXX Unofficial
MaXX Interactive Desktop unofficial scripts and configuration.

## CachyOS
Installer script for CachyOS. Works with no desktop selected, but assumes a display manager has already been setup.

### Note:
Installation works and desktop is usable, but currently some apps fail to launch with `symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libgtk-4.so.1: undefined symbol: png_get_cICP, version PNG16_0`

## OpenSUSE Tumbleweed
Installer script aimed around "Generic Desktop" pattern for minimal system. Should work with other desktop environment patterns.
